## Analysis

### How do people who play for money compare to people who play for fun?


### Do professional players have a better Satisfaction with Life (SWL) score than casual players?


### Are those who play alone more anxious than those who play socially?


### US Residents vs European Residents: who spends more time gaming, and how does it compare to their Satisfaction with Life (SWL) score?
The total of USA and European players makes up the vast majority of the population of the dataset. This number was found by pulling the country names, and manually filtering out non-USA and non-European countries/regions. If time permitted, it would be more efficient, accurate, and beneficial to pull the region data from Geoapify API and compare data from all continents.

The original hypothesis was that US residents would spend more time gaming and have a lower SWL score. The data suggests that on average, gamers in the USA spend fewer hours playing video games per week, and have a slightly better satisfaction with life score than European gamers. These results may also be skewed due to more European players taking the survey than US players.

Histograms were created to show the frequencies of SWL scores (USA versus Europe) and hours played per week. Overall, these charts show that European players reported SWL scores that were spiking in the 15 to 25 range (out of a possible score of 42, with 0 being unsatisfied with life and 42 being most satisfied with life), whereas US players have a more even distribution of scores in the same range. Both regions reported identical average hours played per week (22.31 hours for Europe, 20.45 hours for US), but Europe had a maximum of 140 hours per week and the US had a maximum of 105 hours.

This question could be further analyzed with other factors taken into account, such as employment status, earnings, age, gender, play style, etc.. 

### Sample of Bias Discussion: was this data geared more towards collaborative RPGs versus other games?
